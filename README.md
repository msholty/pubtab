notes
====================

- I consolodated latitude && longitude into a single json param since I feel like it would reduce the payload a bit - every bit counts. The serve that would return this would just consolodate that for us.
- All service responses are using stubs - no api integration was built out for this demo as time did not allow it
- ui is only meant for a mobile phone, but could be used on a desktop if you wanted (still would look nice)
- Because I wanted to finish in a few hours, I didn't set up any grunt tasks to manage my workflow better. If this was a longer term project I would have set up stuff like
	- grunt serve-app
		- compiles the less
		- concats, minifies, uglifies js -> so I don't have to sweat including new files
		- injects bower dependencies
		- serve with express rather than grunt contrib connect
- regarding styles, i put them in css files because i didn't set up a less task to auto build as i was developing, then inject that into my index.html. with more time I would set something like that up

Nice to haves -
- Sort by nearest bar (getting your phones coordinates and filtering by shortest distance)
- filter a pub's menu by manufacturer, price range, beer type (requires more verbose data)
